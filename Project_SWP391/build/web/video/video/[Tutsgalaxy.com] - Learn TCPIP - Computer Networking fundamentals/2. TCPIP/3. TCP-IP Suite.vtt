WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.130
What is CCP IP.

00:02.130 --> 00:06.450
Well this is a sort of protocol that is used on the Internet to communicate.

00:06.570 --> 00:12.150
Meaning that when we accumulating with other devices using the Internet or given that we're going in

00:12.160 --> 00:16.800
jail we are using this CCP IP protocol suit.

00:16.800 --> 00:23.820
So this is a common language that devices have implemented such that they can talk to each other because

00:23.850 --> 00:29.490
if we didn't have these common protocols then two devices did not know how to communicate with each

00:29.490 --> 00:35.100
other because you just can't take a cable cable and connect to devices and then expect them to figure

00:35.130 --> 00:37.110
this out on their own.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.820
They need some basic language that they both understand in order to communicate similar to.

00:43.140 --> 00:50.610
As humans we need to have a language that the two of us understand in order to understand what the other

00:50.610 --> 00:52.020
one is saying.

00:52.080 --> 00:59.580
So the first one TPP which is Transmission Control Protocol this is one of the protocols.

00:59.590 --> 01:03.230
There is also UDP which you're going to discuss later.

01:03.450 --> 01:11.310
But for CCP it is a very fine delivery to endpoint protocol meaning that as we see on the picture right

01:11.310 --> 01:19.920
here when to a device like communicating Herod's pub using his computer and Ellis using her computer

01:20.460 --> 01:23.500
then when they are communicating with each other.

01:23.580 --> 01:28.450
Bob is first sending a request or some kind of package to Alice.

01:28.620 --> 01:35.110
Then Alice acknowledge this and that is where CCP differentiated so from UDP because every time I pay

01:35.110 --> 01:45.220
to send the receiving part is acknowledging the sending request and then the flow continues.

01:45.220 --> 01:53.410
Where we send something and we get an acknowledgment back and this CCP protocol is used within for example

01:53.680 --> 01:55.660
puppetry and hates.

01:55.890 --> 02:04.120
So these are some protocols that uses the CCP protocol to work online.

02:04.150 --> 02:11.320
We will see a map in a few slides so that you can get a bigger understanding of how all this is connected.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.830
But first the IP internet protocol.

02:14.890 --> 02:21.690
This is the protocol says allow us to go one step above the MAC addresses which we discussed in previous

02:21.690 --> 02:22.380
lectures.

02:22.510 --> 02:30.460
MAC addresses is used in for example and hubs when you connect devices then they use their MAC address

02:30.560 --> 02:33.470
to Ms.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.110
Remember who is sending what and to who.

02:37.190 --> 02:44.930
Because without IP IP addresses we can only rely on these MAC addresses since they are hardcoded into

02:44.930 --> 02:46.590
our network interface cut.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.100
But this will only work on our logical network.

02:50.210 --> 02:55.400
But as soon as we go beyond our logical network meaning that we are communicating through the router

02:56.270 --> 03:02.900
out to the global net we need the IP protocol because then we need to have a piece in place in order

03:02.900 --> 03:07.970
to understand what device we are going to speak to and what route we need to take in order to get to

03:07.970 --> 03:09.530
that device.

03:09.530 --> 03:22.460
So that is basically what the IP protocol does and if we see on this picture we have a more basic overview

03:22.460 --> 03:23.950
of some of these protocols.

03:23.960 --> 03:29.350
So as you see right here we have the all say layers which we discussed and lecture one.

03:29.390 --> 03:34.590
So we have our application layer at the top and then we have our data link layer.

03:34.640 --> 03:40.010
And this is supposed to be a two but you hopefully understand that.

03:40.550 --> 03:49.040
So as you see we have the CCP on our Layer 4 and we have the IP on only a tree.

03:49.040 --> 03:57.830
This basically means that DP uses the IP protocol from the tree to do some other protocols for example

03:57.830 --> 04:04.590
it is used by DNS and puppetry and HP and so on.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.110
These are just sort of protocols.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.120
There are many more.

04:07.220 --> 04:11.820
You can feel free to look them up yourself in order to get a full list of all the protocols.

04:11.960 --> 04:21.170
And then we also have UDP which also relies on IP but as I mentioned whereas CCP uses acknowledgment

04:21.320 --> 04:22.640
on transfer.

04:22.640 --> 04:29.600
This one just pump out messages and messages and don't need any confirmation that such a package has

04:29.600 --> 04:30.800
been delivered.

04:30.800 --> 04:40.300
And this is used on our t DTP servers so this is a little overview of how these different protocols

04:41.170 --> 04:45.610
are connected and how they are laid out in the USA model.

04:45.610 --> 04:52.420
So some of the protocols that you just saw on this map where for example the IP address resolution protocol

04:52.690 --> 05:00.370
which is this one right here on our data link layer layer to remember this and that is basically used

05:00.370 --> 05:03.170
to map the eyepiece to make addresses.

05:03.340 --> 05:13.530
Then we have the TTP UDP here as we discussed where our CCP confirmed delivery and UDP just keep delivering

05:13.530 --> 05:14.430
without a receipt.

05:14.430 --> 05:22.650
Then we have the DNS which anyone using the web and who has been surfing the Web have been in contact

05:22.650 --> 05:30.600
with because genius is basically what helps us resolve the endpoints and domains that we type in for

05:30.600 --> 05:39.300
example the visual that Google dot com gets translated into our IP address in order for the computer

05:39.300 --> 05:41.180
to understand what exactly we are doing.

05:41.190 --> 05:44.930
So that is why DNS is very important when we are using the Web.

05:45.510 --> 05:54.000
And then we have the DCP right here which is basically the protocol server who hands out a piece on

05:54.000 --> 05:54.850
a local network.

05:55.740 --> 06:03.540
So when a computer connects to the network this part will take care of handing out eyepiece so that

06:03.540 --> 06:06.970
we can have more than just our mega addresses.

06:07.050 --> 06:12.530
So this was shown on Russian to me as a TTP and IP.

06:12.540 --> 06:19.650
We are now going to go a lot more in depth with these protocols especially DCP and UDP and what differentiate

06:19.770 --> 06:25.170
them and what the benefits are of using one above the other in certain context.
