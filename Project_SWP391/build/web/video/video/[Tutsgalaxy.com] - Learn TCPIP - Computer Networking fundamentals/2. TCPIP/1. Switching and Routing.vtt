00:00.210 --> 00:06.030
So rounding and switching what is the difference as you see in the picture right here.

00:06.030 --> 00:11.310
We have multiple devices and these two different things to our network.

00:11.310 --> 00:17.580
So switching is basically happening on the same network meaning that with internally within your own

00:17.580 --> 00:24.300
network whereas routing is communication between different networks and that is why you see these two

00:24.300 --> 00:34.370
devices hub and switch is on their own network whereas Aurora is connecting them so what is the different

00:34.370 --> 00:36.100
devices that we're going to talk about.

00:36.110 --> 00:40.580
We're going to talk about a hub switch a router and a repeater

00:43.330 --> 00:49.860
So what is a hub will a hub is a very dumb device as you see in the picture here.

00:49.870 --> 00:55.870
You have probably seen one before or you maybe use one in your own network right now but what a hub

00:55.870 --> 01:04.360
to us is basically just received data and then send it out to everyone connected to the hub and then

01:04.420 --> 01:09.490
it is simply up to the computers to decide will they want to accept or reject this communication.

01:09.730 --> 01:16.480
And these network packages this means that if you are sending some information to use a B then if you

01:16.480 --> 01:26.290
have a malicious user in the device C then unless his computer rejects the information to use a b he

01:26.290 --> 01:31.220
will actually also get that information because the hub doesn't care who it sends to it just say OK

01:31.250 --> 01:35.820
here is some data and it just push it out to everyone.

01:36.370 --> 01:38.500
Then we have a switch.

01:38.620 --> 01:43.840
This is truly called a smart hub because it does a bit more than a hub.

01:43.900 --> 01:48.100
This one keeps track on the different computers and devices connected to it.

01:48.430 --> 01:54.220
It does so by making tracks in a table of the MAC addresses.

01:54.310 --> 01:59.950
We have discussed mega address in previous sections and this is Layer 2 and it was a model.

02:00.370 --> 02:08.980
So the switch will start to record what kind of MAC address is being used from the different port within

02:08.980 --> 02:16.150
the device and then it will keep track on what port a specific MAC address is connected to because then

02:16.150 --> 02:21.160
it knows that if some information come from this MAC address to this MAC address then it needs to go

02:21.160 --> 02:23.020
through these two ports.

02:23.380 --> 02:29.740
But this will happen over time so when at the beginning of using a switch when you connect your devices

02:30.100 --> 02:35.680
it is simply just acting like a hub until it starts to figure out which mega dresses belong to which

02:35.680 --> 02:46.860
ports then we have a repeater a repeater is compared to routers and not routers compared to switches

02:46.890 --> 02:48.270
and hubs.

02:48.270 --> 02:53.790
It is used for making the signal stronger.

02:53.790 --> 03:00.960
And as you see on the picture right here we have a repeater at the end of the range of this wireless

03:00.960 --> 03:01.950
network.

03:01.950 --> 03:07.500
And because we have this repeater then it is capable of receiving messages from this computer right

03:07.500 --> 03:11.930
here and then enhance the signal so they can reach reach the computers.

03:11.940 --> 03:18.240
That is actually without the range of this main point right here.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.790
And it can still do so in two different ways.

03:20.790 --> 03:30.210
It can amplify meaning that it just smack their message out with more power and it can do signal regeneration

03:30.210 --> 03:38.130
meaning that it tries to clean up the signal because when our message to transfer either true to our

03:38.130 --> 03:45.780
true cable there will be some magnetic interference and this electric mid-day interference that will

03:47.430 --> 03:50.170
it and then destroy the package.

03:50.190 --> 03:57.900
And that is why we have each these ranges because at some point the device is simply not able to reach

03:57.960 --> 03:59.240
out anymore.

03:59.250 --> 04:06.000
So by having this repeater it can enhance the signal so that we can reach a much larger area.

04:06.030 --> 04:12.270
So we can set these repeaters up on your network at specific locations where you want to signal to be

04:12.270 --> 04:12.720
in hands.

04:12.720 --> 04:23.580
This can be where you have thick walls or where you simply just have too long of a path between your

04:23.580 --> 04:25.940
devices and your main router.

04:25.950 --> 04:32.070
For example if you have your router located at one another house and you want a signal at the very end

04:32.190 --> 04:39.000
of your ground maybe into rats or something then you can use it's a repeater.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.540
And at the ending we have the rotors.

04:42.540 --> 04:50.580
These are the real smart devices and the ones that make all this networking possible because what a

04:50.580 --> 04:57.780
router is compared to a switch and a hub is a very very smart device.

04:57.810 --> 05:03.150
It's managed all the traffic between our internally and the public network.

05:03.150 --> 05:09.730
So around I actually have to eyepiece it has the public IP which is the IP that the Internet is seeing.

05:09.750 --> 05:15.450
And then the head has a private IP IP which is the IP used by your devices on your internal network

05:16.560 --> 05:18.960
and most routers also have build and firewalls.

05:18.960 --> 05:28.110
This means that you can manage your firewall rules based on who is allowed to connect and move packages

05:28.200 --> 05:36.220
to and from your network and the public whereas switches and hubs simply doesn't have such things.

05:36.220 --> 05:44.290
It will just allow everything to happen and then most rioters also have what is called DHEA piece of

05:44.290 --> 05:44.800
a building.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.010
And what such server is doing is to

05:50.950 --> 05:57.220
make your computers have a piece because once you connect to a network as we discussed in previous lectures

05:58.120 --> 06:01.870
about iPods and mac addresses you computer will only have a mac address.

06:01.870 --> 06:10.180
So it needs an IP from somewhere and that somewhere is to be good from such DSP DHB server which is

06:10.180 --> 06:11.270
built into your router.

06:11.320 --> 06:18.400
So what your computer will be doing when it is connected to the network it will use this flow right

06:18.400 --> 06:25.180
here where we first discover we tried to find where the server is located then this is located probably

06:25.180 --> 06:29.600
within your router and then you're allowed to see this and says OK.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.270
You need a new IP then it will make an offer.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.550
Use this IP because this IP is the free.

06:35.710 --> 06:42.520
And then you will just make a request your computer on this and say okay fine I can use this IP and

06:42.520 --> 06:49.330
then you're ratable and which has this the HP server will acknowledge and say OK fine I will note that

06:49.330 --> 06:51.540
down and you are now assigned to this IP.

06:51.580 --> 06:55.170
So this is basically how you get an IP internally.

06:55.180 --> 07:02.170
So now we have quickly discussed the four devices if you want you can look them up yourself and see

07:02.470 --> 07:04.180
all the specific terms.

07:04.180 --> 07:09.790
Maybe look up the device that you have on your network and all to see what is actually on your network

07:10.110 --> 07:16.690
what a configuration is possible then your order in order to to understand this a bit better.

07:16.690 --> 07:19.330
So now we are ready to move on and I will see you next picture.
