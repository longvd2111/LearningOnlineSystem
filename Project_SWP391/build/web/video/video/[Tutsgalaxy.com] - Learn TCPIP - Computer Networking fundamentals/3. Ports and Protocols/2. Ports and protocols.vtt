WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:07.830
So in the last lecture we discussed DCP and UDP which is to communication protocols and we'll start

00:07.830 --> 00:14.280
this off by discussing ports because ports when talking about communication and especially in network

00:14.280 --> 00:21.300
communication is an essential topic because the ports allow us to have multiple apps to use a network

00:21.300 --> 00:28.840
connection meaning that we can have civil apps running on our device that is communicating over the

00:28.850 --> 00:31.770
network because they rely on these different ports.

00:31.860 --> 00:41.280
So on our device we have sixty five thousand five hundred thirty five ports which we can choose from

00:41.910 --> 00:49.140
and softies ports are already assigned a steeple ports two different protocols which you will see in

00:49.140 --> 00:50.370
a minute.

00:50.370 --> 00:57.150
So a port can for example be seen in the end of an IP for example we have the IP right here and then

00:57.450 --> 01:06.030
this is port 80 meaning that whatever communication that is going to happen here is to this IP on port

01:06.120 --> 01:06.780
80.

01:06.870 --> 01:13.940
So there is something listening on this IP at this port for some kind of information.

01:14.220 --> 01:17.400
And as you see right here we have a lot of different ports.

01:17.460 --> 01:21.360
So let's see what can be in these ports.

01:21.450 --> 01:25.580
So on a network and when communicating over a network we have several protocols.

01:25.590 --> 01:28.840
We have seen some of them before and the previous lectures.

01:29.220 --> 01:36.050
But here we will refresh some of them and we'll kind of port the use and what they're used for and as

01:36.050 --> 01:37.660
you see here we have different ports.

01:37.670 --> 01:42.710
We have GDP hits GDP ism GDP is sage poultry and so on.

01:42.710 --> 01:49.850
Some of them probably all we're all ready are quite familiar to you as you have been using their network

01:50.210 --> 01:54.470
and using browsing on your browser.

01:54.470 --> 02:01.730
So the most common protocol that you might have used is hey GDP or hated U.P.S. which we will discuss

02:01.730 --> 02:03.100
in a minute as well.

02:03.200 --> 02:09.080
And these most likely have some default ports assigned to them because since we use these protocols

02:10.490 --> 02:18.170
so much in our everyday communication it makes sense to have default ports assigned to them but ports

02:18.350 --> 02:23.080
used for FCP or is p also have default ports.

02:23.120 --> 02:29.690
But even though they are default they can be changed meaning that you might see if DP communication

02:29.720 --> 02:36.040
if you do a network scan that is not happening on the default port because the people who use this if

02:36.040 --> 02:44.900
DP connection has changed the port you'll often see this when people try to put some kind of security

02:44.900 --> 02:50.420
on the network communication even though it is not that secure because you can just scan for ports and

02:50.420 --> 02:58.820
find out that this has changed but it will give you some kind of basis you to because if newbies are

02:59.150 --> 03:04.940
trying to use the standard port they will not find anything but you should not just only change the

03:04.940 --> 03:05.570
port of anything.

03:05.610 --> 03:10.730
OK I'm I'm secure now you're not but we'll discuss that and later lectures.

03:10.760 --> 03:18.630
So some of the protocols that we have if it's if BP which uses port 21 as its standard port and it uses

03:18.670 --> 03:24.820
CCP protocol as its communication protocol which we discussed in the last lecture.

03:24.830 --> 03:30.770
So if the P stands for file transfer protocol and we use this to transfer files over the network and

03:30.860 --> 03:40.040
this is a secure communication type because our files is not encrypted meaning that anyone can airdrops

03:40.450 --> 03:45.710
it Robyn and see what kind of information we are basically transferring and that is why we need a more

03:45.710 --> 03:53.330
secure protocol which is SFP and that use a standard port twenty twenty twenty two and this is also

03:53.330 --> 04:00.940
DCP this is the encrypted version of ATP and it uses Ice Age for its encryption.

04:00.980 --> 04:06.920
And this is way more secure than FCP so if you're going to transfer anything online with several files

04:06.920 --> 04:11.750
to web host then be sure to use as if to P just for good measure.

04:12.080 --> 04:18.740
And then we have some TB most of you have already been interacting with the last two because when you

04:18.740 --> 04:26.660
are mailing and having a mail client on your device you'll be using these protocols is a SMG piece then

04:26.660 --> 04:33.170
for symbol mail transfer protocol and then that default port for this is 25.

04:33.440 --> 04:39.500
This is also TGP as well as poetry which has 110 as a default port.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.090
This protocol is used when we are transferring males.

04:44.090 --> 04:49.640
So when you are transferring sending a mail from your client to your server and the servers then transferring

04:49.640 --> 04:57.800
that to the receiving server for example if you're using Outlook you will use as a GP to transfer the

04:57.800 --> 05:02.990
mail from your device to Microsoft server makes a full and transfer to for example Yahoo server and

05:02.990 --> 05:11.490
then the user of the Yahoo Mail will then use this to get the last transfer and then we have popped

05:11.490 --> 05:18.200
free which is the post office protocol 3 and that is basically protocol used to download mails from

05:18.200 --> 05:19.670
the server.

05:19.670 --> 05:28.730
So now to the last two protocol to rule go through in this lecture and these are as I mentioned hopefully

05:28.790 --> 05:35.990
the ones that you have used the most because we are using them almost everyday when we are online on

05:35.990 --> 05:36.800
the Internet.

05:36.800 --> 05:44.560
So we have hated deeply and hated CBS This is similar to what we discussed with FTB and if Piers where

05:44.570 --> 05:48.290
we have a secure version and a more secure version.

05:48.290 --> 05:57.710
So for a heated copy we use port 80 and again the DP protocol this is stands for Hypertext Transfer

05:57.710 --> 06:03.380
Protocol and we use this when communicating and reprocess you will most likely have seen it when you

06:03.380 --> 06:10.720
have for example HP SLAs some address that come and you can have hate CBS SLAs something that come as

06:10.730 --> 06:15.860
you see in the picture right here but this GDP is the unsecured version.

06:15.860 --> 06:23.180
So when you are browsing the web your browser is basically sending a get request to a server to get

06:23.180 --> 06:30.200
the information that you need in order to view this web page and all a web page is is basically a file

06:30.200 --> 06:31.420
with some text inside.

06:31.580 --> 06:38.510
So your Brussels say hey I need this file and information because my user is currently going to watch

06:38.510 --> 06:38.950
Google.

06:38.960 --> 06:45.290
So I need to see what is on the Google page and all the information that is transferred between you

06:45.350 --> 06:51.160
and the server is all in clear text meaning that anyone can see whatever is getting transferred.

06:51.170 --> 06:58.430
So this is not very smart when you are for example using people are Facebook or anywhere else where

06:58.430 --> 07:03.680
you have personal information and passwords and that is why we have heat U.P.S. which uses the standard

07:03.680 --> 07:06.720
port 443 over TGP.

07:06.890 --> 07:13.510
This is the encrypted version of HP where we have a certificate between declined and server and he disappears

07:13.510 --> 07:18.320
makes sure that the information that we are transferring is not in clear text.

07:18.320 --> 07:26.060
And as mentioned this is what is the standard when using banking services or any other service that

07:26.060 --> 07:27.430
have personal information.

07:27.470 --> 07:34.100
So that is why it's so important to look for this Hey CPS and is that lock in the corner because then

07:34.100 --> 07:42.270
you know that at least the certificate between you and the server has been signed and that the communication

07:42.270 --> 07:44.090
should be somewhat encrypted.

07:44.330 --> 07:52.920
However there can be some malicious attempts to bypass this but that is for another lecture.

07:52.940 --> 07:57.800
But you should never transfer any personal information or log into any service where you just see a

07:57.800 --> 08:05.170
heated GP and most likely if you're using chrome and all of which makes the server browse dos at will

08:05.600 --> 08:10.000
but you will get recommended before looking that saying hey this is an unsecure Web site.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.060
Do you want to enter personal information.

08:12.140 --> 08:18.460
And also I have read that Google is now displaying search results based on whether people have did he

08:18.490 --> 08:18.690
it.

08:18.740 --> 08:27.050
Yes because HP is not just something that anyone should use anymore because in these days with so much

08:27.050 --> 08:31.560
person information trending over the Web we should rely on G.P.S. as standard.

08:31.580 --> 08:36.690
So this was a lecture about ports and some common protocols.
