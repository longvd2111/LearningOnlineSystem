00:00.090 --> 00:03.870
So what is PGI public key infrastructure.

00:03.870 --> 00:09.030
As mentioned we discussed it a bit in the encryption sections where we looked at symmetric and asymmetric

00:09.030 --> 00:17.790
keys and PCI is based on asymmetric Keys where we have public and private keys so remember that we have

00:17.790 --> 00:24.270
the private keys that we use to encrypt a given data with and then we are sharing our public key which

00:24.270 --> 00:28.740
is related to our private key so that the users can decrypt our content.

00:28.860 --> 00:38.040
And this is really what this PGI approach is based on the public private key relation and how we can

00:38.040 --> 00:40.900
trust that a sinner is who they say they are.

00:40.950 --> 00:43.460
So let's take a look at it.

00:43.470 --> 00:49.950
So in the PGI we have something called S.A. the certificate authority and as you see on this picture

00:49.950 --> 00:55.340
right here this authority is on the tab here at this building.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.120
And then we have a company one and a company too.

00:58.290 --> 01:05.160
So company one needs to talk to company two and since they are going to do this in an encrypted manner

01:05.220 --> 01:11.430
and company two wants to ensure that what they are receiving is from company one they are using this

01:12.150 --> 01:15.520
certificate authority as their main trust source.

01:15.540 --> 01:21.990
This means that both Company 1 and Company 2 are trusting this third party.

01:21.990 --> 01:29.820
So this could be the fourth party company or government organization or someone that both of them are

01:29.820 --> 01:30.970
able to trust.

01:31.110 --> 01:36.420
Meaning that company two don't have to trust company one alone because what is company one wanted to

01:36.450 --> 01:38.190
cheat company two.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.300
So they are trusting this one.

01:40.380 --> 01:52.020
This means that the certificate of are the key manager in this PCI set up right here.

01:52.020 --> 02:00.930
So DEA is going to manage and create the public and private keys for the companies involved right here.

02:00.930 --> 02:08.520
So what this is doing is that when company one wants a certificate they are asking the CIA for private

02:08.520 --> 02:09.230
key.

02:09.300 --> 02:15.510
So the CIA will generate a private and public key for company one that they will hand out the private

02:15.510 --> 02:21.890
key to Company 1 and then they will sign this private key with their own public key.

02:21.930 --> 02:29.010
So see the CIA is saying the private key with the public key so now company one has a private key which

02:29.010 --> 02:31.970
has been signed by the CIA.

02:32.010 --> 02:38.640
So when the company one wants to send the data to company 2 they are going to use the private key they

02:38.640 --> 02:44.180
received to encrypted data so they used a private key then the encrypted data and sent it over to company

02:44.180 --> 02:45.940
two.

02:46.500 --> 02:54.150
Now that company too has received this data they of course want to decrypt it because they can look

02:54.150 --> 02:55.410
at what it is based on.

02:56.400 --> 03:02.970
So since that the data that they encrypted is based on a private key that has been signed by the CIA

03:03.960 --> 03:13.830
the company you can ask the CIA for the public key of their private key because privately they used

03:14.250 --> 03:15.920
to sign the certificate.

03:15.990 --> 03:27.190
So only their public key is capable of decrypting the signed a certificate part of this data because

03:27.940 --> 03:31.530
company one got the private key with the same value.

03:31.780 --> 03:38.410
So company two is getting the company one probably key and they can use to see a public key to decrypt

03:38.710 --> 03:39.550
the same value.

03:39.670 --> 03:47.770
And if they are able to decrypt the same value then they know that company one is who they say they

03:47.770 --> 03:56.510
are because they trust that the CIA has only handed out this same certificate to the company won and

03:56.510 --> 04:01.850
not some random person who said yeah I'm an employee at company one.

04:01.850 --> 04:07.090
Just give me company once private certificate and have it signed please.

04:07.100 --> 04:11.570
No they have investigated and say OK you are actually company one.

04:11.690 --> 04:15.540
So we are going to sign this private key certificate to you.

04:15.560 --> 04:26.650
So when people are asking for the public key needed to decrypt this we can trust they can trust that

04:26.980 --> 04:33.810
we have dude done our background search so that we know that you are company one company.

04:33.820 --> 04:44.860
You can only decrypt the same value if it is coming from a valid signature that has been encrypted by

04:44.860 --> 04:45.720
the CIA.

04:45.730 --> 04:47.830
So this is how this go around.

04:47.830 --> 04:53.940
This is simply and made easy a model of this PCI.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.020
It can be much more advanced.

04:56.020 --> 05:01.990
You can have registration authorities as well and you can have multiple other parties and you can have

05:01.990 --> 05:09.460
a route of authority meaning that the CIA will have a route on its own set that you will trust on several

05:11.890 --> 05:16.950
intermediate certificates as well so you can have a real along change of certificate.

05:17.170 --> 05:22.620
But the important part is that the rude or the.

05:22.790 --> 05:30.070
Yeah the route authority is one that all the parties within this network is trusting because if they

05:30.070 --> 05:39.040
don't then this entire PGI setup has no value because if company one made some shady agreements with

05:39.040 --> 05:45.910
the CIA then company two could not be sure that whatever they received from company 1 were legit because

05:45.910 --> 05:47.670
these two had an agreement in between.

05:47.670 --> 05:56.710
So it needs to be a third party that is independent from the people using this signed value.

05:56.800 --> 06:09.160
And it also B has to be a third party that can be trusted to operate under the rules of this PCI setup.

06:09.190 --> 06:17.650
So I hope that this make made sense for the PTI if it didn't then please re watch this video and try

06:17.650 --> 06:23.470
to see if it makes sense or else go back and take the encryption lecture and the data hashing lecture

06:23.770 --> 06:26.400
and then end up with this PGI lecture.
