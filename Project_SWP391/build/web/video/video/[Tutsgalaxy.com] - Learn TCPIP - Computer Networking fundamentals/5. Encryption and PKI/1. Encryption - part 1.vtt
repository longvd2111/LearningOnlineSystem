00:00.420 --> 00:02.920
First of all what is encryption.

00:02.970 --> 00:08.640
Encryption is when we start off with something in clear takes mean that's something that we as humans

00:08.640 --> 00:09.570
can read.

00:09.570 --> 00:19.520
For example text in the document are something that we have entered on a forum on the web page and then

00:19.530 --> 00:26.780
we want to encrypted so that it is only us and the receiver that is capable of reading this message.

00:27.120 --> 00:33.470
Because if we didn't encrypted then anywhere anybody else could basically read this and we don't want

00:33.470 --> 00:41.310
it especially for sensitive and private information such as password or bank details or personal information

00:41.310 --> 00:43.440
lag insurers no reason and stuff like that.

00:44.400 --> 00:52.440
So encryption is basically all around around taking something from clear text and me into a sever text

00:54.470 --> 01:01.550
so encryption and decryption all comes down to mathematical algorithms where mathematicians has been

01:01.550 --> 01:07.050
spending years on developing these algorithms because we need to know that these are secure.

01:07.130 --> 01:14.270
So we need to have a lot of mathematicians trying to break the code of this algorithm in order for us

01:14.270 --> 01:17.290
to know that well this is basically very secure.

01:17.330 --> 01:23.570
So what is changing in encryption is normally the key or the passphrase meaning the Secret which we

01:23.570 --> 01:25.590
talked about in lecture 11.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.970
Whereas the algorithm stays the same.

01:28.970 --> 01:35.270
So the algorithm that you are using to encrypt and decrypt are probably also used by a lot of other

01:35.270 --> 01:41.390
people in the world especially when it comes to networking because the algorithm on its own is secure

01:41.450 --> 01:47.060
but it is the key and the passphrase that make us encrypt and decode and ensure that it is only us who

01:47.060 --> 01:49.100
can do this decrypting.

01:49.100 --> 01:53.440
So a little example of how encryption works.

01:53.450 --> 01:58.010
Take for example this clear text we have right here we have Vince love.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.940
Then we take this clear text which is our data.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.050
Then we take our algorithm.

02:03.050 --> 02:09.430
This is a very basic algorithm so we simply just say plus K mean that we will take each letter.

02:09.590 --> 02:11.720
And plus it would K meaning a number.

02:12.290 --> 02:15.750
So our number in this case is 1.

02:15.770 --> 02:20.390
So this one plus K is known to the entire world.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.150
So everybody knows this algorithm plus key.

02:23.720 --> 02:29.810
It is a very basic one so you should never use it but everyone knows this algorithm the secret that

02:29.930 --> 02:32.530
nobody should know is what the number is.

02:32.570 --> 02:38.480
Because if they have the same number they can actually decrypt the message again because then they know

02:38.480 --> 02:45.050
how we encrypted so we'll be encrypting this using the Plus key algorithm and they're using our secret

02:45.050 --> 02:46.600
number is 1.

02:46.640 --> 02:51.890
So we take each letter and incremented by 1 meaning that we get this ciphertext right here.

02:51.890 --> 02:56.510
So this is encrypted text you can read the letters but they mean nothing to you.

02:56.510 --> 03:00.470
And you can get the original message out of this garbage.

03:00.470 --> 03:09.740
So we have now encrypted this critics right here using our little algorithm and a secret phrase which

03:09.740 --> 03:18.680
is our number one in real algorithms as we will see and Little League has is much more complex and is

03:19.250 --> 03:23.000
much more secure meaning that you just can't break them by just trying.

03:23.000 --> 03:23.560
OK.

03:23.570 --> 03:24.950
Has he incremented with one.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.390
No.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.370
2 No.

03:26.450 --> 03:28.340
It is much more advanced than that.

03:28.610 --> 03:32.720
But this stands as a good example to understand how this works.

03:32.780 --> 03:36.270
So what you need to keep in mind when encrypting is that we have some data.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.110
We have a given encryption algorithm.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.940
And then we have a secret key or passphrase that we use.
