What is often the occasion of an occasion when it comes to networking is a very important aspects because

00:08.400 --> 00:12.000
when we are using often the occasion we are actually improving who we are.

00:12.150 --> 00:18.840
So we are using over the Haitian whenever we are looking into something or whenever we are encrypting

00:18.840 --> 00:26.610
some data because we need Indian to prove that we are who we say we are and we can't just tell a computer

00:27.030 --> 00:27.670
that will.

00:27.670 --> 00:32.230
I am the administrator and then the computer will ask Are you really the administrator and then we will

00:32.230 --> 00:33.540
just say yes I am.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.790
And they will just say OK fine I believe you.

00:35.790 --> 00:43.440
We need some solid methods that allow us to authenticate and these need to be bulletproof so that the

00:43.650 --> 00:51.300
wrong users can exploit them and exploit the fact that they are not administrators and get access to

00:51.300 --> 00:53.340
something that they are not supposed to.

00:53.580 --> 01:00.760
So when talking about vindication there is a word that is especially important and that is the known

01:00.770 --> 01:07.560
reputation and we will getting closer to that in the coming lectures where we are starting to dive into

01:07.890 --> 01:15.500
encryption certificates and the more technical stuff of how often the case is actually used in networking.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.460
We have touched a little upon it in the previous lectures where we briefly have mentioned it from time

01:20.460 --> 01:26.790
to time where our indication is used and how it plays along and this entailed working.

01:27.690 --> 01:34.900
But when talking about authentication it's important to understand the different often case methods

01:34.920 --> 01:42.520
that we have and we actually have three factors of how often location known at the present time.

01:42.600 --> 01:48.020
So we have something that you have something you are and something you know.

01:48.150 --> 01:52.710
These are three basic ways that you can authenticate to anything.

01:52.710 --> 01:59.370
This does not only applies to networking but in general there are these three areas and whatever else

01:59.400 --> 02:06.970
you can try to imagine you can some how also fit them into these three main boxes.

02:07.530 --> 02:14.790
So something you have that is for example an I.D. card or a physical token that you need to present

02:14.850 --> 02:17.520
to get access to something and something

02:20.350 --> 02:33.500
you are is for example fingerprints and eye scanner are something that is uniquely to you as a person.

02:34.030 --> 02:40.540
And then we have something you know which is our usernames and our passwords.

02:40.780 --> 02:45.160
The one often the case in fact that is most known to all of us.

02:45.160 --> 02:50.890
Is this something you know because password and username has been around for many years and that has

02:50.890 --> 02:54.100
been the main way that we often indicated something.

02:54.190 --> 02:59.960
But we are now starting to see a shift where a lot of services is implementing what is called multi

02:59.960 --> 03:01.370
factor authentication.

03:01.540 --> 03:08.710
And when we are talking about multi fact authentication it basically come down to us using two of these

03:08.710 --> 03:10.920
authentication factors instead of one.

03:10.930 --> 03:15.070
So whenever you're using two of these you are having multi effect of indication.

03:15.160 --> 03:20.770
For example you can have something you know you use name and password that is one and then you need

03:20.770 --> 03:26.530
something else in a multiple factor for example something you have and that is for example your mobile

03:26.530 --> 03:28.110
phone you have your mobile phone.

03:28.120 --> 03:34.300
So the service will also send a code to your phone number and you will not need that code alongside

03:34.300 --> 03:39.490
your password and username or it could be when you are entering a building.

03:39.490 --> 03:44.560
It could be something you know again a password and something you are your fingerprint in order to get

03:44.560 --> 03:45.340
access.

03:45.340 --> 03:51.640
So these are the three factor of indication that we currently have.

03:51.640 --> 04:01.990
So when we are talking about Web services especially the way that web services and Web pages or networks

04:01.990 --> 04:08.620
have evolved in the last decade we are starting to see what is called is a so which is singles sign

04:08.620 --> 04:15.400
on it that is especially used if you have played around with Google Apps once you have a Google account

04:15.490 --> 04:21.540
and you are locked into a Google account you basically have access to the Google obviously suite.

04:21.670 --> 04:28.480
Google Drive you have YouTube access you have access to Google Analytics are and all the different applications

04:28.480 --> 04:29.640
that Google use.

04:29.950 --> 04:35.170
And what is basically happening when you are off indication of indicating to this is that you lock in

04:35.170 --> 04:44.830
once and then the service is handling their information transfer meaning that they will be sure to prove

04:44.830 --> 04:50.470
that you have the right to enter a particular site based on what you have entered once and is actually

04:50.470 --> 04:57.250
a pretty smart way of doing a vindication because then you are not exposing your password several times

04:57.280 --> 05:03.550
and you are not having the risk of someone getting access to that password each time you're logging

05:03.550 --> 05:05.480
in because you only do that once.

05:05.500 --> 05:11.050
The only downside of this is that you have to trust a server that you're doing this with because then

05:11.440 --> 05:18.220
the Security entirely is up to them and if they can't keep your password safe when doing this transfer

05:18.220 --> 05:27.400
between apps then yes you are basically out of Logan and your password can be exposed but these are

05:27.400 --> 05:33.940
the basics of authentication and it is very important that you get familiar with these three of any

05:33.940 --> 05:39.220
case in fact us because these are the ones that we are going to talk about and the common lectures.
