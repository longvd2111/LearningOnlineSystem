00:00.420 --> 00:03.770
So let's see what this IP sic is.

00:03.790 --> 00:14.730
IP 16 for IP security and it encrypts data at least tree meaning the IP layer and then we have underneath

00:14.820 --> 00:22.620
IP tech we have four sub protocols because IP sic uses these sub protocols to perform its task.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.270
We will in the next life see a graphical illustration of how this works.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.960
But first we will go through them.

00:28.230 --> 00:33.220
So the first protocol we have is ISP encapsulation security payload.

00:33.240 --> 00:40.620
This is the protocol that encrypts the content meaning the data that we have with a symmetric algorithm.

00:40.620 --> 00:46.680
This means that both the client and the server will have the same algorithm so that what is used to

00:46.680 --> 00:53.200
encrypt the data can also be used to decrypt the data because you cannot just encrypted on your side.

00:53.220 --> 00:59.340
And then just hope that the server somehow managed to figure out what whatever you encrypted it with

00:59.460 --> 01:04.900
the need to be a correlation between them and you need to exchange some information for this to work.

01:05.070 --> 01:07.120
But USP is the encryption part.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.920
Then we have HP.

01:08.940 --> 01:16.170
Often the case in header this is a header that is added on to our data package which have a checksum

01:16.710 --> 01:17.240
in it.

01:17.310 --> 01:26.160
In order for our server or ourself when receiving RECEIVING PACKAGES again to check up and secure that

01:26.160 --> 01:31.770
no one have tamper with this data because if they have then the checksum and the hash of this of indication

01:31.770 --> 01:33.630
header will simply not match.

01:33.630 --> 01:41.400
And we know that someone has been trying to manipulate this data and we either know that our encryption

01:41.640 --> 01:49.020
or private network has been broken or some something has gone run wrong to do away from our point A

01:49.020 --> 01:50.190
to Point B.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.490
Then we have the IP come which is the IP payload compression.

01:54.660 --> 02:01.340
This is where our payload meaning our data and our authentication header is getting compressed Saturdays.

02:01.560 --> 02:10.290
It is of a smaller size before we send it because the less data size that we have the faster it is and

02:10.290 --> 02:11.940
the less bandwidth we use.

02:11.940 --> 02:17.400
So it is very important that we can compress it as much as possible before we actually send it.

02:17.640 --> 02:23.610
And then we have the last protocol which is the IEEE Internet key exchange and that is the protocol

02:23.640 --> 02:27.690
that negotiate this shared secret between us and the receiver.

02:28.170 --> 02:36.330
So as I said in the ISP the encapsulating security payload we need to negotiate some she had secret

02:36.360 --> 02:42.410
in order for us to be able to encrypted in one end and for the receiver to decrypt the other.

02:42.450 --> 02:45.620
So we need to have some common knowledge in order for this to work.

02:45.630 --> 02:49.380
So this is basically the force of protocol to IP sic users.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.330
So let's see how this works.

02:52.350 --> 02:59.340
So the first thing that we have is the part one we need to negotiate a shared secret or key before we

02:59.340 --> 03:05.490
can start doing this so that we have an understanding of what it is used to encrypt and what is needed

03:05.490 --> 03:10.650
to decrypt once that is in place we can encrypt the data with ISP.

03:10.770 --> 03:14.320
So for example we have a package right here with the black square.

03:14.730 --> 03:19.500
We have data then we will encrypted with this green layer right here.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.220
So now this entire data block is encrypted in the next part.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.070
We will at this of indication here.

03:25.100 --> 03:32.310
So we will add it to the data package which is encrypted and therefore we will add a new encrypted layer

03:32.400 --> 03:39.360
around this entire package to around the header and around the data because then the header is encrypted

03:39.360 --> 03:39.860
as well.

03:39.960 --> 03:46.860
And then there will be a minor header to this encrypted package with the receivers information because

03:46.860 --> 03:50.210
we need to detail where this is to be sent to.

03:50.220 --> 03:56.310
So this is when we are encrypting our data on one end and then the receiver is getting the package the

03:56.310 --> 04:00.170
first thing that he is going to do is remove the other encryption layer.

04:00.210 --> 04:02.910
So he removed this blue box right here.

04:03.030 --> 04:08.580
Then he will check the header see if everything is in order has the data been timber red.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.110
And then it will be removed.

04:10.110 --> 04:15.350
So we would take out the header and then at last he will decrypt the data.

04:15.390 --> 04:21.060
So he will encrypt the screen box right here and remove it and then he is capable of reading the exact

04:21.060 --> 04:25.590
same data that we started off by sending right here.

04:25.590 --> 04:32.460
So this is basically how VPN protocols and the different set protocols is used to do this entire virtual

04:32.460 --> 04:35.200
private work over a public network.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.080
But we need one more protocol and that is the ISC KMP protocol.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.610
So the Internet Security Association and key management protocol.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.030
It's a very long name.

04:46.260 --> 04:52.620
And if you're really into this VPN stuff and you need to go beyond the basic which is this is all about

04:52.890 --> 04:59.520
then I highly recommend you to do some reading of the details of these different protocols because there's

04:59.640 --> 05:03.820
a lot of more into them than just what I have listed right here.

05:03.890 --> 05:05.450
But this is the basics.

05:05.750 --> 05:09.810
So this protocol is actually used to establish the tunnel.

05:10.100 --> 05:18.470
And that is what do this that exchange of keys and provide the tools needed for us to have this tunnel

05:18.530 --> 05:26.000
before we can start to use their L2 GP protocol and IP sic on top of that.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.270
So this is basically how VPN from client to server over our public network works and how it is getting

05:32.270 --> 05:35.150
encrypted using several sub protocols.
