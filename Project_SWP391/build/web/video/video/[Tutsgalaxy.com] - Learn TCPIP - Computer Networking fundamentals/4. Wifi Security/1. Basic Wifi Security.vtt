00:01.110 --> 00:07.180
Wi-Fi security and why it is important to implement and be aware of how to use secure Wi-Fi.

00:07.930 --> 00:10.610
Basically Wi-Fi has replaced cables.

00:10.630 --> 00:15.790
In most cases so before when Wi-Fi weren't that popular.

00:16.330 --> 00:21.630
Almost every device computer and so on were connected to the Internet through cables.

00:21.790 --> 00:29.740
But now as mobile devices and instant the thing is starting to get more and more popular we are seeing

00:29.740 --> 00:38.710
that Wi-Fi is basically replacing all the Wired installations that we have and most computers are also

00:38.710 --> 00:45.190
now getting switched over to laptops meaning that they will most likely also be run on wireless.

00:45.190 --> 00:53.380
Of course there are still stays stationary computers and so on which use cables but will you get the

00:53.950 --> 00:54.780
point.

00:54.790 --> 00:57.850
So now no Wi-Fi has become such a public thing.

00:57.940 --> 01:04.330
We are facing our security threat that we did not have with the cable because when we were using cables

01:04.690 --> 01:11.950
only we had an easier time controlling who had access to our network because basically they needed to

01:11.950 --> 01:18.850
plug our cable in their device that then connected to our switch hub or router in order to be connected

01:18.850 --> 01:19.700
to a network.

01:19.840 --> 01:28.420
But with Wi-Fi basically every device that is within range of our Wi-Fi signal will be able to see this

01:28.420 --> 01:29.020
Wi-Fi.

01:29.020 --> 01:36.870
And if it is not protected in the right way they will be able to connect UID and start collecting packages

01:36.900 --> 01:39.040
and information from their network.

01:39.950 --> 01:50.630
So the most important thing when it is when we're talking about Wi-Fi and wireless security is the wireless

01:50.630 --> 01:56.990
encryption because when if you're just transferring packages over an open network with no encryption

01:58.190 --> 02:06.770
you can imagine that everyone that is within the signal range of this way if I could just plug in and

02:06.890 --> 02:13.190
connect to this Wi-Fi and then then they will be able to collect your packages and because you did not

02:13.190 --> 02:20.260
encrypt the trafficked that you send between you and the router or hub or switch you will basically

02:20.800 --> 02:25.080
be giving them all the information to read because it will be in plaintext.

02:25.120 --> 02:32.800
So that is why open Wi-Fi networks are very bad and you should avoid them at all cost if you can in

02:32.800 --> 02:33.140
future.

02:33.140 --> 02:39.430
Later we will look at weapons and other approaches that you can use to still connect to your local open

02:39.580 --> 02:42.460
Wi-Fi at Starbucks and still be protected.

02:42.730 --> 02:48.880
But here we will focus on our setup that we will have at home or at work.

02:48.880 --> 02:57.080
So we have these different protocols that we can use to encrypt our traffic and the access to our Wi-Fi.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.340
The first one is WIPP where equal and privacy.

03:01.390 --> 03:09.490
That was the original protocol used when Wi-Fi first came along and you should never ever use this protocol

03:09.490 --> 03:11.530
at all because it is very easily broken.

03:11.530 --> 03:18.940
There are some flaws in the mathematics of this encryption protocol that makes it very easy for people

03:18.940 --> 03:27.370
to crack the encryption key and thereby decrypt the traffic that you are sending and get access to you

03:27.430 --> 03:28.600
to Wi-Fi.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.770
Then we have the W EPA which is wildfire protected access.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.080
That was a temporary enhancement of the original protocol and it provided some more security.

03:40.090 --> 03:47.140
But again it has inherited some of the security flaws that were in the original protocol.

03:47.140 --> 03:50.550
And this is now also something that I don't recommend you to use.

03:50.560 --> 03:57.640
And if you see a network that is having this or your home network is only secured with this protocol

03:57.880 --> 04:03.880
you should try at all cause to either switch to this protocol and if your device does not support that

04:04.480 --> 04:07.890
I hope it does because every new device does so.

04:07.960 --> 04:13.420
But if you have a variable device that does not support this then I recommend to replace that device

04:13.740 --> 04:20.980
so that you can use the Wi-Fi protect access to protocol because that is currently the most secure one

04:20.980 --> 04:25.630
to use when talking about Wi-Fi security and traffic encryption.

04:25.930 --> 04:34.720
It replaces the original WPA protocol and it uses a as advanced encryption standard which is a much

04:34.990 --> 04:41.700
more secure way of encrypting your data and network.

04:41.770 --> 04:46.830
Again it is not that this is bullet proof and that it will not ever be hacked.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.650
There are some ways it is very difficult.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.570
But again nothing is totally secure.

04:53.860 --> 04:58.810
So it's not like when you're using this you can say OK I'm secure if I'm for more everything.

04:59.220 --> 05:06.400
Some type in some future there will be some hacks and found some flaws in this as well.

05:06.400 --> 05:13.830
And then this will become depreciated as well but currently this is good to go and you can use this.

05:14.080 --> 05:22.420
And there are already coming some new protocols along there are the WPA tree which which is even more

05:22.420 --> 05:27.710
secure protocol but that is not as widely used as this is.

05:27.730 --> 05:34.390
So again be sure that you are using this on your network when you are setting it up and then you should

05:34.390 --> 05:40.190
be in a safe manner when it comes to encrypting your unit again and traffic.

05:40.520 --> 05:49.130
But there are also other things that we can do to secure our wireless network because wireless networks

05:49.440 --> 05:56.820
as mentioned is based on signals and the great thing about wireless network is that we can connect any

05:56.820 --> 06:02.360
of our devices as long as we are within range of our signal.

06:02.520 --> 06:08.280
But at this also a security risk because it is not only us who can connect.

06:08.280 --> 06:14.000
It is also everybody else who is within this range that is able to connect and start to try Craig or

06:14.040 --> 06:18.240
network or collect packages from our network.

06:18.270 --> 06:25.770
So besides using encryption to secure network you should also be aware of how strong of a signal you're

06:25.770 --> 06:37.170
using and where you are placing your access point because people from outside your house or office can

06:37.170 --> 06:42.660
actually access your network as well as you have might seen if you're traveling through a city with

06:42.660 --> 06:44.220
a lot of buildings.

06:44.220 --> 06:50.670
If you go to your mobile and look at what Wi-Fi is available you will see a very long list because there

06:50.670 --> 06:59.000
are so many access points who is just broadcasting the signal out because they are.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.950
The signal is so strong in most newer devices.

07:02.130 --> 07:07.980
So it is important that you are aware of where you place your device and the strength of the signal

07:08.070 --> 07:14.160
that you're sending because if you look at this picture right here let's imagine we are in this office

07:14.160 --> 07:18.140
building right here and this is our wireless router.

07:18.180 --> 07:25.500
This is sending out a signal in every direction with a very strong strength meaning that a malicious

07:25.500 --> 07:32.670
user could sit in this car for example and try to crack our network if we had an open network he could

07:32.670 --> 07:33.630
just log on.

07:33.650 --> 07:39.810
Even though that he is sitting on the street within his car you can actually have the same benefit as

07:39.810 --> 07:48.380
if you were sitting next to you in your own office place but also if your building is placed near to

07:48.380 --> 07:54.740
a park or other public place fuel could actually just be sitting outside chilling with a computer and

07:54.740 --> 07:59.490
they could try to break into your network and that is of course something that we want to avoid.

07:59.570 --> 08:05.360
Even though we have password and encryption sit on or known at work it is still a very low security

08:05.360 --> 08:12.540
risk that people can unharmed they sit and try different approaches to break unit.

08:13.040 --> 08:18.380
So what you should be aware of is how you place your device and what strength.

08:18.380 --> 08:24.050
So imagine that we had this office building right here and we had the two top floors.

08:24.050 --> 08:32.040
So there is no reason that we have our network being available at the first floor of this building.

08:32.040 --> 08:38.280
So what we could do is to first move the router because instead of placing it at our first floor when

08:38.280 --> 08:45.090
we have the above floor as well meaning that we will broadcast to places that we do not own and is not

08:45.090 --> 08:53.400
part of our office we will just move the RA rah up to the second floor which we are also owning.

08:53.400 --> 09:00.360
And then we will adjust the signal so that it is only broadcasting to the very end of our building and

09:00.360 --> 09:07.410
you can do that by simply just taking our wireless network card or laptop or mobile and then just go

09:07.410 --> 09:12.550
to the first corner of your office and then see do I have a signal right here.

09:12.660 --> 09:18.270
If the signal is very strong then there is a very good chance that on the other side of your wall or

09:18.270 --> 09:21.070
below the floor there is a signal as well.

09:21.150 --> 09:27.870
So you should try to minimize the strength of the signal in the corners because then you know that there

09:27.870 --> 09:34.350
is a very low possibility that people from outside your actual physical space can connect to you to

09:34.350 --> 09:36.200
your wireless network.

09:36.210 --> 09:41.410
So this was a short introduction to Wi-Fi security.

09:41.490 --> 09:46.250
We will not go into that with the encryption algorithms because they will be for another tool.

09:46.260 --> 09:48.750
This is the network basics.

09:48.750 --> 09:54.810
So we just covered the basic aspects of this Wi-Fi security and in it coming lectures we will look at

09:54.810 --> 10:01.680
how we can use different approaches to secure our communication when sitting on open networks by using

10:01.680 --> 10:08.670
weapons and we will also look at how we can set up different tunnels and how we can use SSA age to connect

10:08.680 --> 10:11.730
security to over the Internet.
