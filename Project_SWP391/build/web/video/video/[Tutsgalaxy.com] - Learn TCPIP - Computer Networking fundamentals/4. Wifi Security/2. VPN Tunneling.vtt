00:01.110 --> 00:04.260
VPN stands for a virtual private network.

00:04.530 --> 00:12.690
And this is technology that enable us to have a private tunnel and connection over a public internet

00:13.110 --> 00:20.040
which is encrypted so that only us and decide that we are connected to is able to read the data that

00:20.040 --> 00:21.570
is transmitted.

00:21.570 --> 00:27.810
So for example when you are logging into public networks either at Starbucks or when you visiting a

00:27.810 --> 00:33.810
hotel when you are travelling you will most likely find that there they provide some kind of public

00:34.200 --> 00:36.240
Internet service for our customers.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.970
So if you log on that network and you don't use for example a VPN then anyone else who is under the

00:42.970 --> 00:49.630
Internet as well which have some baggage sniffing software running is actually capable of collecting

00:49.630 --> 00:52.580
the Pegasus packages that you are transmitting.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.280
And if they are not encrypted they can basically read them.

00:56.310 --> 01:06.330
So we want to have measures such as we begin to secure our data and also by using VPN we can rely on

01:06.330 --> 01:10.940
that the information that we are accessing is kept confidential.

01:11.010 --> 01:16.290
And this is especially needed if you're working for a company and you need to access some company resource

01:16.320 --> 01:22.300
then you don't want a competitors or anyone else to look at these files as well.

01:22.710 --> 01:30.930
So let's look at the two ways that we have within the first one is clan to site so clan to side is where

01:30.930 --> 01:36.750
we as a user connect either to our home network or our war work space.

01:36.750 --> 01:44.330
It can also be to our club if we have by at some club that have a private network.

01:44.340 --> 01:50.280
But basically we connect as a user to another network and we are doing that remote so remote access

01:50.280 --> 01:53.100
VPN and is this picture right here.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.710
We can see how it is work.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.090
So for example let's imagine that we are at a hotel and we have the company that we are working on right

02:00.090 --> 02:07.800
here and on the company we have internal server which has some confidential files that we need to access

02:07.800 --> 02:11.310
in order to do our work from remote on this hotel.

02:11.310 --> 02:17.640
So this hotel is providing a public network meaning that any guests at this hotel can get a free code

02:17.730 --> 02:20.010
at the reception and they can log in.

02:20.010 --> 02:26.190
So they are all within the same tunnel because they are all using the same internet connection and this

02:26.190 --> 02:30.000
Internet connection from the hotel is then connected to the broader internet.

02:30.540 --> 02:36.450
And the same is our company our company has some internal resources and it is connected to the Internet

02:36.510 --> 02:39.870
so that it can transmit information.

02:39.900 --> 02:46.200
So what we want to do with our client side VPN is to create our own dedicated tunnel using the already

02:46.200 --> 02:48.860
existent existing tunnel.

02:48.900 --> 02:56.940
So when we connect to a VPN client either by a VPN service then we have brought or by using some official

02:56.940 --> 03:01.480
company connection that has been set up by our our I.T. department.

03:01.650 --> 03:07.170
We will actually be creating a closed tunnel between us as a user and our company.

03:07.590 --> 03:10.620
So this is illustrated with this blue line right here.

03:10.620 --> 03:16.630
So this blue line will be a virtual private network within this broader tunnel.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.580
That is the entire hotel network and its connection to the Internet.

03:20.640 --> 03:27.120
So we will have our own little close connection from our computer to the public route of the hotel from

03:27.240 --> 03:29.290
there are a two tier Internet.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.550
And then over the Internet and down to the company.

03:33.210 --> 03:39.060
So this means that all information that is going through this close tunnel is encrypted.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.090
So if anyone tries to sniff up the packages or look at what data is transmitted all they will see is

03:45.090 --> 03:50.050
some garbage because it's encrypted and they will not be able to read it.

03:50.070 --> 03:57.360
So in that way we can securely access the server on in the company and we can say I want to download

03:57.360 --> 04:02.880
this file and then this file will get transferred from the Internet company server of the router and

04:02.880 --> 04:09.500
then through the Internet and down to the hotel where we are sitting using this secured line a lot of

04:09.500 --> 04:15.440
companies also have policies for using viewpoints because they are aware of that if they don't have

04:15.590 --> 04:22.700
a VPN connection set up right then the information that you are accessing in from the company internal

04:22.700 --> 04:29.140
resource will be exposed or might be exposed and used by competitors.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.460
So this was client to site VPN.

04:31.640 --> 04:39.020
Then we have side to side VPN side to side VPN is compared to client side where we connect two networks

04:39.020 --> 04:39.910
together.

04:40.100 --> 04:45.620
And this is especially used in business related matters where we have multiple offices that needs to

04:46.220 --> 04:49.830
act as they are connected using the same network.

04:49.910 --> 04:56.120
You can also do this by have a leased line meaning that you have a dedicated Internet line only for

04:56.120 --> 05:03.460
your company use but that is in most cases very expensive and VPN is a cheaper alternative to that.

05:03.890 --> 05:10.310
And then when you have such VPN side to side it can either be persistence mean that it is available

05:10.310 --> 05:15.020
at all times whether or not you're using it or it can be dial on demand meaning that it will only be

05:15.020 --> 05:18.250
activated once you need the weapon.

05:18.440 --> 05:25.280
But compared to say to planned where we had it from our single computer and then connecting to our company

05:25.370 --> 05:33.440
we are now sitting at this office too and we want to have the employees of this office feel that as

05:33.440 --> 05:39.740
they were sitting at the main office because at the main office we have all our servers and the employees

05:39.890 --> 05:43.450
of office two should also be able to use these resources.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.660
So the entire office internet connection will be connected to the office one internet connection meaning

05:50.660 --> 05:57.200
that there will be a tunnel from office one to office two so any device that is logging on to the office

05:57.200 --> 06:02.820
to Internet and using the secured password and so on.

06:02.930 --> 06:09.890
But as soon as they get locked into this internet they will actually have an active VPN tunnel to office

06:09.890 --> 06:16.400
one meaning that no matter if you're sitting in office to office one your computer will actually act

06:16.460 --> 06:21.860
as it was sitting in the office one because you will have the same access rights.

06:21.890 --> 06:30.980
So by using this you can get past the normal firewalls which should be set up at any company where they

06:30.980 --> 06:33.050
don't allow access from outside.

06:33.260 --> 06:37.380
But by using this VPN the firewalls will see that.

06:37.490 --> 06:37.820
OK.

06:37.850 --> 06:42.600
This is actually a resource that is on the right network and I will let it through.

06:42.620 --> 06:48.800
So this is two different kind of weapons and in the next lecture we will look at what protocols are

06:48.800 --> 06:53.510
used and ribbons because VPN is not a protocol on its own on its own.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.700
It relies on a lot of different protocols.

06:55.730 --> 07:01.700
So we need to take a closer look at how this entire encryption technique is actually used utilized by

07:01.700 --> 07:02.600
the VPN service.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.240
So I will see you in the next lecture.
