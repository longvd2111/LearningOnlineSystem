00:00.540 --> 00:02.850
So what is a MAC address.

00:02.850 --> 00:09.470
A MAC address is a synonym for media access control and compared to IP addresses.

00:09.570 --> 00:18.110
It is a unique address that is hardcoded into our network interface cut and that is the case for both

00:18.180 --> 00:23.550
our cable card and our wireless card meaning that it is a unique physical address.

00:23.640 --> 00:29.000
And as you see on the picture right here it is shown as a hexadecimal format.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.610
Again you will know about hex.

00:31.650 --> 00:36.530
This month formal in the last lecture part two where we discussed it.

00:36.990 --> 00:41.470
And whereas IP addresses were in the layer tree of the assigned model.

00:41.520 --> 00:50.980
This is layer to so who choose this MAC address since it is a unique hard coded address.

00:50.980 --> 00:56.290
It is the companies that produces the network cards that we have in our computers and devices that has

00:56.380 --> 00:59.500
a different range based on the producer.

01:00.010 --> 01:07.990
So each producer of network cards have a certain range that they can give addresses in that in between

01:07.990 --> 01:09.080
that space.

01:09.190 --> 01:13.890
So you can actually look up your MAC address and see who produced your network card.

01:13.930 --> 01:20.860
You can do so by using the first command on a Windows IP config slash all that will give you this physical

01:20.860 --> 01:21.850
address right here.

01:21.850 --> 01:29.410
Then you can copy this address and into this you will write here and then you will see similar information

01:29.410 --> 01:30.210
like this.

01:30.220 --> 01:36.310
So here I see what company produced and what address they have and what range of MAC addresses they

01:36.320 --> 01:39.040
are capable to give.

01:39.040 --> 01:45.460
So this is a quick way to look up some more information about it it cut and what range ranges is used

01:45.460 --> 01:47.530
by that company.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.150
So what is this MAC address.

01:49.150 --> 01:55.030
Useful without the MAC addresses our computer would not be able to identify themselves on a network

01:55.150 --> 01:57.820
before they get an IP.

01:57.820 --> 02:02.680
That means that when you set up your network for the first time and you just take your computers and

02:02.680 --> 02:09.900
couple them into around us or switches no eyepiece has been distributed to no devices really no.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.470
Who do other devices are.

02:12.250 --> 02:20.290
So in order to get the eyepiece your device will most likely ask you a router or the HP for IP and then

02:20.320 --> 02:27.300
it will reply with an IP that is free on this network and then your computer will simply say fine I

02:27.300 --> 02:31.530
will take this IP and then the DCP will notify that.

02:31.530 --> 02:38.100
But in order for that communication to happen the router and device need to understand who each other.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.950
So they will use the Mac addresses.

02:41.070 --> 02:48.590
So until the IP is defined it is the MAC address that is used to communicate between.

02:48.680 --> 02:57.350
So before we jump to the next part which is switches roads and bridges which will give you a better

02:57.350 --> 03:03.920
understanding of a picture like this as you see we have switches we have routers and we have a lot of

03:03.920 --> 03:05.890
multiple devices connected.

03:06.140 --> 03:11.060
We need to quickly discussed some of the cost measures we have.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.920
So we have unique cast in our network.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.980
We have multicast and we have broadcast so unique cast is a one to one communication meaning that one

03:18.980 --> 03:22.450
device is communicating with another device.

03:22.460 --> 03:29.360
So once one then we have multicast meaning that one device like this one is just communicating with

03:29.540 --> 03:35.480
multiple devices so it is casting out some information and multiple devices are getting that information

03:36.450 --> 03:42.830
and then we have the last one which is broadcast and that is that meaning that any computer in the broadcast

03:42.830 --> 03:45.820
domain is getting this message thrown at them.

03:45.830 --> 03:53.450
So if you see this as a network then the broadcast domain is all the computers and devices that can

03:53.450 --> 03:59.180
be reached reached by the MAC address meaning that it is internally within a router.

03:59.780 --> 04:07.340
So for example in this one right here we have a router right here and then we have a lot of devices.

04:07.370 --> 04:13.940
So a broadcast of all these devices could be able to reach each other but they will not be able to reach

04:13.940 --> 04:19.370
the devices on the Internet because they are simply not in the broadcast domain because they can simply

04:19.370 --> 04:21.280
be read by their MAC address.

04:21.380 --> 04:28.760
They will need to be read through the router and then the public ip of whatever router or this nation

04:28.820 --> 04:30.080
they have.

04:30.080 --> 04:36.500
So now that we know about IP addresses MAC addresses and a different cost measures it is time to move

04:36.500 --> 04:41.610
over to switches routers bridges and I will see you in the next lecture.
