00:00.660 --> 00:03.000
So what is networking.

00:03.000 --> 00:09.990
Well networking or network is two or more devices that is connected and can thereby communicate with

00:09.990 --> 00:11.570
each other.

00:11.820 --> 00:17.280
And that is really what we're going to focus on in this entire course that we have multiple devices

00:17.280 --> 00:19.310
that are able to talk to each other.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.190
So we are going to look at how such can happen.

00:23.190 --> 00:30.300
And when we say networking it might sound kinda simple because when we say oh we are just communicating

00:30.420 --> 00:36.660
over a network or we are just sending information but you can compare it to shipping when you're talking

00:36.660 --> 00:37.220
about shipping.

00:37.220 --> 00:43.530
That also sounds very simple but when you dive into the different aspect of shipping a parcel as we

00:43.530 --> 00:49.320
see in the picture right here there are so many different steps that someone has to take care of before

00:49.860 --> 00:56.580
the package gets from the shop where you bought it to your front door and it is the same with networking.

00:56.580 --> 01:02.190
Whenever we are doing something online there is a lot of steps that is happening behind the scene and

01:02.190 --> 01:07.530
that can be broken down through as same model which we are going to talk about in this lecture.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.220
So do as I model.

01:10.500 --> 01:18.270
This is the network model that is defining all the aspects that are happening when we are doing communication

01:18.300 --> 01:18.950
or one that work.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.520
And it consists of seven layers.

01:20.640 --> 01:26.730
So we have layer one the physical layer which is the lowest layer and the lowest level where we have

01:26.730 --> 01:35.340
the electric bikes and cables where we have Layer 7 which is the application meaning the application

01:35.370 --> 01:38.690
and front and that you're interacting with which is the highest level.

01:38.790 --> 01:41.000
And then we have these different layers in between.

01:42.150 --> 01:48.420
So before we get into the different layers it's more important that we understand how it is or same

01:48.420 --> 01:50.190
model actually works.

01:50.190 --> 01:56.640
So even though that we now know there are these several layers it's important to see how this is working

01:56.640 --> 01:57.630
in practice.

01:57.630 --> 02:05.520
So for example if you have computer a right here a computer be right here then a person on a is going

02:05.520 --> 02:11.250
to send something to computer b he is starting on the application layer and then he is working on the

02:11.250 --> 02:17.220
computer and the electronics bit within his computer is working its way down from application layer

02:17.250 --> 02:22.950
all the way down through the different layers until it resets it reach the physical layer and then it

02:22.950 --> 02:27.990
is going to be transferred over to computer B which is starting from the lowest layer and then working

02:27.990 --> 02:34.030
its way up until it is capable of sending the data that computer a send.

02:34.050 --> 02:36.720
So this is how to assign model works.

02:36.720 --> 02:44.970
It start from the top in to one and all the way down and it goes from the bottom up in the other end

02:45.180 --> 02:45.940
to them.

02:45.960 --> 02:51.450
So we have the first layer which is the physical layer and as I mentioned before this is the lowest

02:51.450 --> 02:52.060
level.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.630
So this is cable and byte.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.990
It is here we have the electric

02:59.180 --> 03:05.320
voltages happening and it is here we have our network interface cut and it is also here we have all

03:05.330 --> 03:14.690
cable so this is on the very basics where it is not cold anymore but the electric impulses that is getting

03:14.690 --> 03:22.460
transferred to the cable then we have to layer to which is the data link layer and this is where we

03:22.460 --> 03:32.880
Peg it our bytes into frames and it is also in this layer that we have our mac addresses on our computer

03:32.910 --> 03:39.930
which is a unique address that is hardcoded into your network card meaning that compared to an IP address

03:40.260 --> 03:43.290
is something that you can change whenever you want.

03:43.290 --> 03:51.120
You cannot change your mac address you can do mega spoofing but it is totally another thing.

03:51.270 --> 03:53.240
But again you can simply change this.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.750
So this is the layer to where we are using Mac addresses.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.100
If we're going to communicate then we have to lay a tree which is one step above.

04:02.580 --> 04:08.820
And this is where we get introduced to the IP addresses whereas we for before and layer two relied on

04:08.820 --> 04:09.530
mega addresses.

04:09.540 --> 04:19.210
We are now using IP addresses so an IP address is really a logical address and it is definitely hardcoded.

04:19.220 --> 04:26.660
So it is something that can be changed when we are in need of a new one and therefore it is not a unique

04:26.690 --> 04:33.320
address because either it can be changed on your local machine internally within the network or your

04:33.530 --> 04:37.620
Internet service provider can change it in their setup.

04:37.700 --> 04:43.930
So it is not something that is hard coded and it is also this layer that is doing the network routing.

04:43.940 --> 04:50.780
So whenever you are using a router for example that is a tree device because it is distributing packages

04:50.780 --> 04:56.720
based on the different eyepiece and it is sorting who is going to get what based on the IP addresses

04:56.870 --> 04:57.610
on the packages.

04:57.620 --> 05:01.750
That is going to be transferred then we have to leave for.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.440
Which is the transport layer.

05:03.570 --> 05:12.690
This is they manage and control layer where we are starting to see different ways of transferring information.

05:12.690 --> 05:20.930
For example we have the TTP and UDP which is two different protocols for the TTP we are in need of getting

05:20.930 --> 05:24.530
identified and verified that our data is reaching our target.

05:24.830 --> 05:30.230
So if you're using a TTP protocol whenever we are sending something out we need to get our response

05:30.230 --> 05:37.340
back saying I got this package set menu one but if we use UDP which is the one that is most likely being

05:37.340 --> 05:47.610
used on all streaming services and especially YouTube we are just trolling packages as to what our target.

05:47.780 --> 05:52.940
And we don't really care if they receive them in the right order we are just spamming them with data

05:53.000 --> 05:59.840
because if we needed an confirmation for each packages then the load time will be tremendous.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.310
And that is not really smart.

06:01.370 --> 06:08.990
So this is in the letter for that we are dealing with these two different protocols and it is also where

06:09.020 --> 06:17.990
we are splitting the communication that is coming from the layers above layer four down into these packages.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.700
Then we have the layer five which is the section position layer.

06:22.700 --> 06:27.200
This is the layer that is controlling our traffic meaning that it is the layer that is establishing

06:27.290 --> 06:31.150
and it is managing and it is terminating our connection.

06:31.160 --> 06:39.950
And it also coordinate this communication and take charge of how much we are allowed to send and when

06:39.950 --> 06:41.320
we are allowed to send it.

06:41.330 --> 06:49.010
So whenever you are going online it is the layer for that is taking charge of establishing the connection

06:49.670 --> 06:52.650
when you are getting connected to something online.

06:52.670 --> 06:59.540
And it is also delay of five that is in charge of turning this connection so that we don't have thousands

06:59.600 --> 07:00.550
of connections.

07:00.550 --> 07:06.230
If when we are done using them then we have to lay a six which is the presentation layer.

07:06.380 --> 07:09.790
This is the layer that is right below the application layer.

07:09.800 --> 07:16.970
So this is where our data is getting transformed into a format that our application can understand.

07:16.970 --> 07:23.000
So for example when we have some packages that God sent to us it is layer six that is transforming it

07:23.060 --> 07:31.030
into for example X a mill or doing encryption or decryption on it before it is presented in the application.

07:31.070 --> 07:41.090
So the last layer layer 7 application layer this is where our data is presented and this is where we

07:41.090 --> 07:45.150
are getting access form our application to the network.

07:45.230 --> 07:52.310
And this can happen over here GP if GP is A.P. based on what we are going to do if it mail simply were

07:52.310 --> 07:53.780
browsing or file transfer.

07:54.620 --> 07:59.990
So this was a quick overlook of the seven layers and it was a model in the next pictures.

08:00.020 --> 08:08.180
We will dig deeper into each of them along the way to understand this complex area of networking.
